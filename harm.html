			<h3>Using the Internet to Harm Others Online</h3>

			<h5>A Tool For Revenge</h5>
			<p>
				In 2010, a man name Hunter Moore launched a website named Is Anyone Up.   This website became the first of its kind within a disturbing 
				trend of what is known as revenge porn.  The purpose of revenge porn websites is to allow the anonymous posting of nude photographs by 
				ex-lovers when a relationship does not end in a clean break.   Simply posting nude photographs is not enough for many users, as it was fairly
				common for revenge porn submissions to include extensive personal details about the victim such as their name, common locations and even links
				to their Facebook pages (Stroud 168).  When personal details are tied together with posts on a revenge porn website, the results show up in 
				search engine queries, creating issues for potential employers or anyone who searches a victim’s name (Stroud 170).  As if names and locations
				were not bad enough, the copious amounts of personal identifiable information people willingly post to Facebook creates security concerns for 
				each victim.   Posting personal information in addition to nude photographs invites dangers such as stalking and sexual assault into the victim’s
				life.

				Revenge porn is a perfect example of how people can hide behind the anonymity of the Web to cause real harm to others.  The success of revenge porn 
				sites depends on the attacker, who ironically hides behind anonymity, taking away the victims anonymity in order to do maximum damage to the person 
				who hurt them (Stroud 171).  In fact, according to Internet archives, the slogan of Is Anyone Up was “Pure Evil” indicating that users of revenge porn 
				websites have an active desire to harm their victim.   A variation of revenge porn websites are called take down sites, where people post nude photographs
				of their exes for blackmail purposes, often requesting a sum of money to take the photos down.  Earlier this year, a man in California named Kevin Bollaert 
				created his own revenge porn website and charged victims $350 dollars to take down their pictures.  Kevin was eventually arrested and sentenced to 18 years 
				in prison, but the effect that his actions had on his victims included general feelings of helplessness, as if their entire life was ruined, and suicide 
				attempts ("Judge jails 'revenge porn'”).

			<h5>The Dark Side Of Anonymity</h5>
			<p>
				In 2003, an image board named 4chan was developed by Chris Poole.  Although originally designed for Japanese animation enthusiasts, 4chan grew 
				to become an all-encompassing message board and birthplace of popular Internet culture (Knuttila 2).  No registrations for the site is required.
				4chan users all post under the same username “Anonymous”.   The most popular board on the site is the /b/ board, which is the name for the 
				“random” section where anything goes in regards to content.  It is fairly common for distasteful and even illegal content to be posted in this 
				section of 4chan.  The anonymity of 4chan draws the worst out of people when the guidelines for allowed content are very open ended.  In November
				2013, a 4chan user posted to /b/ that he was going to take his own life on camera to “give back to the community in the best way possible” 
				(“4chan user ‘Stephen’”).  Another 4chan user set up a chatroom specifically for the incident and people encouraged him to continue rather than
				try to get him to stop.  Stephen consumed pills with alcohol and then set a fire in his room before laying down in his bed to die.  Fortunately,
				firefighters were able to rescue him before his life expired.  However, Stephen’s rescue does not take away from the alarming fact that people
				can and do use the Internet to encourage others to harm or even kill themselves.

				In a paper written about expressing one's true self on the Internet, Bargh, McKenna and Fitzsimons propose two reasons why people are motivated 
				to express their true selves online.  The first is that humans want other people to see them as they see themselves. The second reason is the true 
				sense of self consists of aspects which do not get validated by the people in our everyday real life.  These two reasons can be combined to explain
				how bad behavior can propagate over the Internet.  As humans, we want certain aspects of our lives to be validated by others.  When people who 
				have cruel intent join forces online through a platform such as 4chan, they can become a disruptive and destructive force.  If somebody meets 
				others online who share similar desires to explore negative identities, it is as if their desire to act out bad behavior is validated.  This is
				because each person has found someone else who shares the same feelings, regardless of how negative, and through this union has felt a sense of
				validation.   Unfortunately, the Internet is full of sites that bring people, both good and bad, together.
