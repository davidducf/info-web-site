			<h4>Identity on the Internet</h4>

			<p>
				Throughout history, the concept of identity has been heavily rooted in social situations and responsibilities.  
				In decades past, the widely accepted idea of identity as a unitary structure reflected the social norms in place 
				during that time. The unitary model for identity describes our concept of self as having a centralized core which 
				we are expected and in some ways obligated to maintain in order to preserve relationships and adhere to social standards.
				It was normal for people to put on different personas depending on a given social situation, but because society valued 
				face-to-face human interaction the influence of these personas were kept in check (Turkle 179). Many social scientists 
				and psychologists, such as C.G Jung (as cited in Blargh, McKenna, and Fitzgerald 34) proposed that the identity we assume 
				in public is simply a mask for the unconscious self, which is a better representation of our true identity. For many people, 
				there were no appropriate outlets for exploration of their true identity that were also socially acceptable.

				The computer revolution of the late 20th century brought not only high-tech computers and Web infrastructure, but also great changes 
				to the way people developed their identities.  Once technological advancements reached the point that nearly every household had a 
				computer connected to the Internet, the content that people both created and consumed was only limited by their imagination.  When 
				going online, people have the ability to reveal as much or as little information about themselves as they want.  Because of this, many 
				uses of the net allow for varying degrees of anonymity.  Web forums or blogs provide nearly total anonymity behind a screen name, while 
				social networks like Facebook provide little to no anonymity through encouragement of revealing personal information.  The anonymity of 
				Web based communication allows people to explore aspects of themselves that were never possible to explore in the days before computer 
				technology.  Identity is now associated with multiplicity, meaning that our true sense of self is made up of an aggregation of both our 
				online and offline personas (Turkle 1999).   The idea is that we use the Internet as a tool to test out different identities that we long 
				to express but cannot in real life, and these different identities help us gain a better sense of who we are as an individual.

			Internet technology makes it very easy for users to create and destroy online personas with just a few clicks of a mouse.  Whether it is an avatar for 
			an online game or a clever handle for a chat room, the identities we explore online are very expendable.  When used as a tool for identity development 
			and exploration, the Internet can provide users with healthy and beneficial realizations that help them with some aspect of their real lives.  However, 
			just as quickly as it helps, the Internet can hurt those who depend heavily on the Internet for defining their identity.  Both the positive and negative 
			aspects of identity exploration through the Internet will be discussed in the sections that follow.
