			<h4>The Internet and Negative Development of Identity</h4>

			<p>
				Although we are able to play with limitless identities on the Internet, not every identity we wish to create is a positive influence 
				on ourselves or the others who may encounter it.   The aspects of ourselves that we cannot express in real life due to social restrictions 
				are most likely character traits that should not be expressed digitally or physically.   The typical attitude is that it is better to express 
				negative desires online where we are protected by a veil of anonymity rather than real life where you are more likely to suffer consequences.  
				This attitude coupled with a growing dependence and importance placed on computer mediated communication for our general well-being could have 
				serious undesired results.

				In a separate section of Life on the Screen, Turkle discusses how collaborative virtual environments known as MUDs can express the dark side 
				of human desires.  In one example, Turkle discusses how knowledgeable players were able to abuse a programming bug which allowed them to take 
				control of another user’s character.  The attacker used this exploit to virtually rape a female character within the MUD.  Following the attack, 
				the victim voiced concerns and called for punishment on the MUD’s mailing list.  She was reported as being visibly upset, even to the point of 
				crying, over the unjust behavior her character experienced in the MUD.  Virtual murder within MUDs was shown to have potential to cause real 
				life distress offline.   Turkle raises the hypothetical question:  If somebody spends months carefully crafting a virtual persona in a MUD, and
				another player murders it, what affect does that have on the victim offline (p.254)?  Given that virtual death can occur just as instantaneously 
				as physical death, there must be some connection or emotional consequences that affect our identity when our online personas are harmed in some 
				fashion.

			<p>
				It is clear that our online identities are heavily rooted in our offline identities.  The examples of negative expressions of identity highlight that 
				this relationship is reciprocal, meaning that our offline identities are also affected by our variable and potentially infinite amount of online identities.  
				Though MUDs are obsolete, the same examples discussed prior can be related to message boards, blogs, chat rooms and even certain social networks.  Both the 
				positive and negative aspects of identity development have something in common: dependence upon anonymity to feel comfortable expressing one’s true self. As 
				we have seen, the anonymous nature of the Web can be used by people to help themselves and others.  With the examples of MUD rape and murder, we have seen how 
				the Web can hurt people’s concept of themselves.  Bad behavior online goes much further beyond identity concerns.  Anonymity is one part of a larger issue known 
				as online disinhibition, which considers additional factors besides only anonymity as the cause for bad behavior online.
