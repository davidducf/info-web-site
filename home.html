			<h3>Positive and Negative Uses of the Internet</h3>
			<p>
				Using the Internet today is almost unavoidable.  Technological advancements and viral marketing has created both the possibility and desire to place reasonably 
				priced Internet devices in the hands of those fortunate enough to afford them.  As a result, the influence of the Internet has permeated nearly every facet of 
				our professional and leisure lifestyles.   Not many people would argue over the trails that high-tech devices blaze in the fields of entertainment and productivity.   
				Smart devices excel at their simple job of keeping people connected to each other in an always online state.  All of these devices are just vehicles for content consumption 
				and creation on the Web, ensuring that we always have the comfort, or sometimes discontent, of our favorite blog, forum, or social network right at our fingertips.  
				What is often overlooked by nearly all of us as we are distracted with our various online interests is what the Internet does for us and allows us to be in regards to identity.  
			</p>
			<p>
				This website displays how the Internet as a technology allows people to explore different aspects of themselves in ways not possible or feasible in real life, as well as the positive and 
				negative effects this invaluable feature of the Web has on society as a whole.   In addition to identity development, this website discusses anonymity in online communication and how the 
				rules of the Web facilitate the spread of good and bad behaviors which may have real world consequences worth considering.   Finally, ideas for countering or tempering negative behaviors online 
				will be mentioned as well as comments on why preventive measures present great challenges on the ubiquitous Web.
