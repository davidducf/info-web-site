			<h3>Glossary</h3>

			<p class="glossary">
				<a name="link1"><b>Online Disinhibition:</b></a>  The lack of social inhibition attributed to the anonymity of online communications. The idea behind online disinhibition is that when people
				communicate online, they feel less restricted by social rules and ques that may inhibit behavior during face-to-face converstations. Conventionally, there are two recognized 
				types: toxic and benign online disinhibition.  The former refers to bad behavior online, such as cyberbullying or flaming, whereas benign disinhibition leverages
				anonymity for positive personal benefits, such as working through an emotional struggle.  
			</p> 
							
			<p class="glossary">
				<a name="link2"><b>Firewall:</b></a> A hardware device or software program that filters Internet traffic against a set of internal rules defined by the user.  On an enterprise level, the rules are 
				set by a network administrator, but for a personal home firewall the rules are set by the customer. Nearly all of the mainstream operating systems, such as Windows or Mac, have built in software firewalls
				that are pre-configured or auto-configured so the user never has to deal with the complexities of networking.  You can use a firewall to restrict access to or from certain sites by basing rules on IP address,
				port number, and protocol ID.  Some newer firefalls are smart enough to detect specific types traffic from specific sites.  For example, a network administrator may allow facebook access, but block its chat
				feature.  
			</p>
		
			<p class="glossary">
				<a name="link3"><b>MUDs:</b></a> Multi User Dungeons. MUDs became popular during the Internet boom of the 1990s.  They were originally text-based online multiplayer gaming environments where 
				a user would create a persona and navigate through a fantasy world using commands typed on a keyboard. After gaining enough popularity, MUDs evolved to cover educational and social interests 
				rather than strictly gaming.  These were the early form of message boards or chat rooms.   
			</p>
			
			<p class="glossary">
				<a name="link4"><b>Unitary vs. Multiplicty concept of Identity</b></a> The unitary concept of self is centered around social classes and restrictions that social conventions place on an individual's identity.  The 
				restrictions set by a person's social status hinders them from exploring possiblities of alternative concepts of identities.  The multiplicy model defines identity as an aggregation of many different "masks", or situation-specific 
				personas that sum together to produce a true sense of self. The Internet is seen by psychologists as a platform for identity development because the anonymity of the Web allows users to explore different aspects of themselves
				that face-to-face social conventions prohibit. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="glossary">
				<a name="link5"><b>4chan:</b></a> A very popular message board that has been refered to as "the wild west of the Internet" by some. People post anomymously to message boards covering a wide array of personal interests, naughty or nice. 
				4chan is the hive for Internet subculture.  A popular hactivist group <span class="italic">Anonymous</span> grew from 4chan's userbase.  <span class="italic">Anonymous</span> has gained both positive and negative media atention for their
				antics, which often include disruptive attacks on websites boasting a different belief system or simply for the "lulz".
