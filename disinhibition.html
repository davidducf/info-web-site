			<h4>Online Disinhibition</h4>

			<p>
				The concept of online disinhibition is centered on the fact that the Web offers its users a space that exists separate of the physical 
				world which is bound by social rules and regulations.  When people use the Internet, they are able to stay anonymous, thus creating a 
				separation between online and offline lives (Suler 322).  But anonymity is not the only explanation for online disinhibition, there is 
				also a factor of invisibility.  Invisibility in this context refers to the fact that when people utilize online-based text communications
				they do not physically see one another giving each party a feeling of invisibility.  The lack of visual cues like body language remove normal 
				social inhibitors that would restrain somebody during face-to-face conversations.  These factors join together to produce a general lack of 
				vulnerability and responsibility for negative behavior online.

				In 2011 there was a study done to determine how heavily the factors of anonymity, invisibility and lack of eye contact contributed to toxic,
				or negative, online disinhibition.   The study included 142 college students between the ages of 18-24.  The goal of the study was to see if 
				any one factor contributed more so than another by observing hostile behavior such as flaming.  Students were split into groups of two and 
				were given the task of debating a controversial scenario through online chat designed in a way so that only one of them could be the winner.
				Variations in the proposed factors of disinhibition were introduced to the groups so that differences could be observed.  The key findings of 
				this study were that the groups that had no eye contact during the chat produced triple the amount of threats when compared to the similar 
				group with eye contact. Likewise, the groups with anonymity but no eye contact were observed to have a higher negative atmosphere than the 
				anonymous groups with eye contact.  These results show that anonymity combined with invisibility and lack of physical proximity can provide 
				those with malicious intent a very comfortable environment for doing their deeds.

			<p>
				When combined with the phenomenon of online disinhibition, Internet technology can easily be abused to spread mean, misleading, hateful and even
				embarrassing content to anyone in the world and incredibly fast speeds.   The Internet has become a weaponized vehicle for spreading rumors, 
				cyberbullying, seeking revenge and general mischief that has real world effects varying in severity.  Examples of what the Internet allows us to 
				do to one another, as well as the consequences of negative online behavior will be discussed in the sections that follow.
